# 4-Way-LinkedList Implementation

- This list implementation was used for a console game in C++, the list
is filled reading the txt file called "map.txt" and the actual internal representation
of the list after lecture can be fine in the file "map.png". In the actual game, the list
represents the whole map, each character represents a different obstacle or part of the map.
